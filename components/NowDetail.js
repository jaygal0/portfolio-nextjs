      <h5>Playing basketball</h5>
      <p>
        The past week I've found myself getting back to the hobby that I enjoy
        most; playing basketball. Whether it's playing alone or with random
        strangers in the only basketball court in the city centre, I've been
        enjoying my time shaking off the rust.
