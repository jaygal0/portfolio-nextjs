      <p>
        The workload at work has been a little overwhelming lately. Rather than
        working on my personal projects in my off-time, I decided to blow off
        some steam by playing computer games again. More specifically, NBA 2k16.
        It's the only game that was available that I enjoyed.
      </p>
      <p>It has been ages since I played video games. </p>
