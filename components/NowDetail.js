      <h5>Prioritising</h5>
      <p>
        I like to develop myself in many aspects of life. Which is why I have
        quite a few on-going projects running simultaneously. Lately, I have
        found myself struggling to keep up with it all and have realised that
        it's best to reduce the workload, otherwise, I'm not going to progress
        in any project.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's time to focus on one project at a time, it'll be beneficial for my
        well-being, development as well as the project itself.
      </p>
      <p>Time to start prioritising.</p>
