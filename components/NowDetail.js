      <h5>wrapping my head around backend programming</h5>
      <p>
        I thought I'd make the most of my semester by learning how backend works. More specifically, Node.js and MongoDB. Now that I have more experience with front end and have built a few websites/apps, I thought it would be good for me to get to grips with what goes on the other side.
