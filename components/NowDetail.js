      <h5>Turned 32</h5>
      <p>
        A couple of days ago I celebrated my 32nd birthday, which officially
        makes me old. Just kidding, I'm grateful to have turned 32 and I'm
        looking forward to celebrating more birthdays with the people that I
        love.

      <h5>Bouldering</h5>
      <p>
        I recently purchased a one month bouldering membership with my partner.
        We've been making the most of it and have gone climbing 2-3 times per
        week. It has been fun and I'm hoping we'll renew it to a yearly
        membership once our current one is done.
      </p>
      <h5>wrapping my head around backend programming</h5>
      <p>
        I thought I'd make the most of my semester by learning how backend
        works. More specifically, Node.js and MongoDB. Now that I have more
        experience with front end and have built a few websites/apps, I thought
        it would be good for me to get to grips with what goes on the other
        side.
