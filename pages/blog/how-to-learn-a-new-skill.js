              To learn a new skill is a rewarding experience. It’s that sense of
              accomplishment that you did something productive with your time,
              but when was the last time you had that feeling?
            </p>
            <p>
              Take a moment and reflect on your life. How much have you
              developed since last year? How about the last three years? Look
              back five years if you can.
            </p>
            <p>Go on, I’ll give you a moment.</p>
            <p>
              If you’ve realised that not much has changed, then you’ve been
              falling behind. I hope this information doesn’t paralyse you, in
              fact, I’d rather it do the opposite. I hope it gets you motivated
              to do something with your life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning new skills is rewarding. It’ll open new doors, you’ll
              meet new people, and you’ll gain a ton of new experiences, but
              tackling a new skill can be overwhelming. From the beginning,
              everything is stacked against you. No wonder why people quit early
              and never reach their goals!
            </p>
            <p>
              From playing an instrument to learning a new language, learning a
              new skill can be broken down into manageable chunks.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this article, I plan to guide you on how to approach any new
              skill to allow you to learn faster, excel in your chosen field,
              and reach your potential.
            </p>
            <p>Are you ready?</p>

              I can remember when I gave myself the challenge of surprising my
              girlfriend by learning her native language – Swedish to be exact –
              we were celebrating her birthday and she was blowing out her
              candles on her cake.
            </p>
            <p>
              At that moment, I knew for her next birthday I wanted to do
              something special. I wanted to be able to talk to her fluently in
              Swedish.
            </p>
            <p>
              How did I do?{' '}

              Understanding the motivation behind learning a new skill is a key
              factor. This is important because there are going to be a lot of
              ups and downs.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may get complacent with your progress or you find the
              information is too much to bear. This is normal. If you have a
              strong reason, it’s going to keep you motivated to stick with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              What’s yours? Do you want to surprise a special somebody? Do you
              think your new skill is going to help you in your job? Or is it
              going to have lasting benefits to your health? Whatever it is,
              make sure that it’s a strong enough reason. If not, I assure you,
              it’ll only be a matter of time until you drop the skill
              completely.

            <h5>How Prepared Are You To Learn Your Skill?</h5>
            <blockquote>
              <h5>By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.</h5>
              <p>Benjamin Franklin</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I had given myself the incredible task of learning another
              language in less than 12 months.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to research the authorities in the field of language
              learning. I’d search the web, constantly reading and finding
              information that I could apply to my own learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the time, preparation is overlooked when tackling a new
              skill. We tend to jump straight into learning a new skill as it’s
              more fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, learning a new skill isn’t all fun and games. You
              have to take the time to understand your skill, what do you need
              to learn in order to improve? What information do you need in
              order to excel?
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember every skill can be broken down into small manageable
              concepts, you just need to find out what they are. If you’re not
              too sure where to begin I would do a quick search on the internet
              and type,
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                “Experts in learning <strong>__</strong>
                <strong>_</strong>”
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                “How to learn <strong>__</strong>
                <strong>_</strong> effectively”
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                “Best tools to learn <strong>__</strong>
                <strong>_</strong>”
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>That should start you off in the right direction.</p>
            <h4>Are you Practising your Skill consistently?</h4>
            <blockquote>
              <h5>
                If I skip practice for one day, I notice. If I skip practice for
                two days, my wife notices. If I skip for three days, the world
                notices.
              </h5>

            </blockquote>
            <p>
              As I sat at my desk, I had notes scattered out in front of me. All
              that was left for me to do was to start practising.
            </p>
            <p>
              Practising a skill is important, but not just any practice, I’m
              referring to a type of practice that requires intense focus;
              ‘deliberate practice’ (also known as ‘deep practice’). If you’re
              consistent in your deliberate practice it’ll only be a matter of
              time until you see a vast improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to remain consistent, it’ll help to plan out your
              learning sessions for the week. Be honest and ask yourself,
            </p>
            <p>“How much time can I spend in deliberate practice every day?”</p>
            <p>
              Review your calendar and make a note when you can commit to
              deliberate practice. It’s important you protect these learning
              sessions at all costs.
            </p>
            <h4>Are you being held accountable?</h4>
            <blockquote>
              <h5>
                Accountability is the glue that ties commitment to the result.
              </h5>
              <p>Bob Proctor</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              There were times where I was skipping a few days not feeling
              motivated to practice at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would often reflect on my ‘why’, but sometimes it wasn’t enough.
              That’s when I realised that I couldn’t do it on my own. I needed
              to be held accountable by someone else.
            </p>
            <p>
              Accountability is a powerful psychological tool that can 10x your
              motivation. The thought of letting someone else down is enough to
              motivate you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask a family member or a person you can trust to hold you
              accountable. Get them to check-in on you every day/week or month.
              If you can, put something on the line as it’ll act as a powerful
              psychological tool.
            </p>
            <h4>Can you teach Your Skill?</h4>
            <blockquote>
              <h5>While we teach, we learn.</h5>
              <p>Seneca</p>

            <p>
              A few weeks had gone by since I successfully surprised my
              girlfriend. I was still buzzing from it. It was a year riddled
              with perseverance and determination, but I eventually reached my
              goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my journey, I realised I had grown significantly and I had
              attained new knowledge that I wanted to share. This led me to
              create ‘
              <a href="https://galiway.blog" target="_blank">
                Galiway
              </a>
              ’. A place to write down what I learned and teach anyone who
              wanted to listen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teaching a skill to another person is an effective way to speed up
              your own learning. By explaining complex concepts to another
              person, it forces you to break down concepts as simply as
              possible. This helps you understand and process the information
              better.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don’t start teaching straight away, especially if you haven’t
              grasped specific concepts. You should only start teaching once
              you’ve gained enough experience under your belt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Find a family member or someone who is willing to listen. If you
              can’t find anyone who wants to listen, create a blog and write
              down your findings. Try to tackle a complex concept and teach it
              as simply as possible.
