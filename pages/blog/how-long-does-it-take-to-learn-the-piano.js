              Before I attempt to answer the elusive question, “how long does it
              take to learn piano?” Let me try and be the voice of authority by
              showing you my own experience of learning piano, how long it took
              and what I did to get to the level that I’m currently at.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal was simple. Teach myself the piano piece “Mia &amp;
              Sebastian’s Theme” from the movie La La Land. For those of you
              that have seen the movie, you know what scene I’m talking about.
              You know, the scene where Ryan Gosling starts going crazy on the
              piano and won over my respect.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I found out that prior to the movie Ryan Gosling had little
              to no experience with playing the piano, I was inspired to learn
              the piece myself. My thinking was,"if he can do it, why can't I?"
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a tall order that lead me down a long path of many ups and
              downs. It lasted a lot longer than I had imagined, but I was
              grateful of what I learned in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ll outline my entire approach and how long it took in a bit, but
              before you take my word, it would be a good idea to watch the
              video below to see if you want to carry on with this article.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://youtu.be/KAhmTaMhhok" target="_blank">
                It’s not perfect (look at me making excuses already), but when I
                look back at my progress, it pleases me to see how much I’ve
                progressed with playing the piano.
              </a>
            </p>
            <h5>My Starting Point</h5>
            <p>
              If you’ve decided to carry on reading after watching the video it
              means you didn’t think I totally sucked.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would be lying to you if I said that my starting point was that
              of a complete noob.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any normal 7 year old can tell you that learning classical piano
              isn’t really on the top of their list of after school activities.
              I, however, didn’t have much of a choice. My parents forced me to
              learn the piano and I hated it. They meant well, but their
              approach wasn’t the best.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a few boring lessons that included going up and down the C
              major scale with a very old classical pianist, I cried to my
              parents and managed to get myself out of it. That was my
              short-lived life of a grade 1 classical pianist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although I got my wish, it’s a decision I regret to this day. Now
              that I’m older, I appreciate the ability to be able to play piano
              and I wish I had stuck it through, but I was a stubborn 7 year
              old.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward several years later and just like every other
              teenager in the noughties, I decided to pick up the guitar as well
              (you can probably thank John Mayer for that). I took it quite
              seriously and even got pretty decent if I say so myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was self-taught and I figured out my way around the guitar by
              watching a lot of YouTube videos. And I mean a lot of them. From
              watching guitar tutorials to understanding music theory, I was
              always trying to get better.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would touch the piano every now and then, but every time I
              played I would approach it from the mindset of a guitarist. Which
              every pianist would tell you is quite limiting.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I’m trying to get at is that prior to teaching myself piano,
              I had been exposed to music for quite some time, but not enough to
              say that I can confidently play it.
            </p>
            <p>
              There were many different aspects to the piano that I wanted to
              get better at. Sure, I could put a few chords together, but I
              wanted to know how to sight-read (the ability to read music) as
              well as play certain complex piano pieces.
            </p>
            <h5>Give Yourself A Goal</h5>
            <p>
              It’s important to know which direction you’re heading towards when
              learning piano. Whether they’re big goals that are broken down
              into little goals, each goal is a landmark that gets you one step
              closer to your ultimate goal of learning how to play piano.
            </p>
            <p>
              For me, the goal was simple. To be able to play “Mia &amp;
              Sebastian’s Theme” from the film La La Land.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had two options. Learn by rote, which meant that I would watch
              someone play the piece, follow along and just keep playing it over
              and over again until I got it down. This is what Ryan Gosling did.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other option was to teach myself how to read the music sheet.
            </p>
            <p>I did a little of the two together.</p>
            <p>
              Since I didn’t have anyone who could teach the piece to me, I had
              to figure out what each note was by reading the music sheet. Once
              I figured out the notes, I would watch someone perform the song
              (on YouTube) and just keep playing it until I had it down.
              Whenever I would forget a certain section, I would refer to the
              music sheet since I was able to read music.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a quick search on the internet I found a{' '}
              <a href="https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0191317&amp;ca=0&amp;cmpid=art_dja28&amp;utm_source=art_dja28&amp;utm_medium=campaign">
                music sheet
              </a>{' '}
              that I thought was similar to the original.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that I had the music sheet in front of me, I had to figure out
              what on earth I was looking at!
            </p>
            <p>
              The process was painstakingly slow. I had to understand what every
              line meant, what every space represented, where every note was
              located on the piano. Fortunately, I had a basic understanding of
              music theory from my days teaching myself the guitar, but I was
              starting from zero when it came to reading music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Naturally, the more I would read, the more I would get better at
              it, which meant the more I would be able to play. The pace I
              progressed depended on the complexity of the song.
            </p>
            <h5>Life Will Happen</h5>
            <p>
              The goal was set, the methods of learning the piece were in place
              and all I had to do was sit down in front of the piano, figure out
              what every note I had to play and attempt to put it all together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, life didn’t go as smoothly as one would hope. I had
              started this project in late 2018 and only felt confident enough
              to record myself mid-2020 (I’m still not happy with the final
              outcome).
            </p>
            <p>
              In-between that time several life-changing moments had happened:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>I moved to another country to live with my partner</li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.galiway.blog/3-months/">
                  I learned the language
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>I left my old business to start a new one</li>
              <li>Got engaged</li>
              <li>Became an uncle</li>
              <li>The list goes on and on …</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I’m not trying to give myself excuses, but you can see why
              learning piano wasn’t always at the top of my list.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting this project, I was diligent with my{' '}
              <a href="https://www.galiway.blog/deep-practice/">
                deliberate practice time
              </a>
              . I would dedicate at least an hour a day of practice. However,
              when life got busy – especially during my move to another country
              – I would fit in time in front of the piano only whenever I got
              the chance. Which wasn’t often.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re going to start learning piano, you’re going to have to
              understand the long journey ahead of you and be willing to put in
              the time. Life will happen and the excuses are going to pile up,
              but you’re going to have to balance the two together if you want
              to make real progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don’t make the same mistake that I did and let other aspects of
              life get in the way of your progress.
            </p>
            <h5>Give Yourself A Hard Deadline</h5>
            <p>
              My time in front of the piano was sporadic and I knew if I had
              continued at this rate I would never learn the piece.
            </p>
            <p>
              Weeks (even months) would go by without me touching the instrument
              and that’s when I told myself,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                No matter what, in one months time I’m going to record myself
                playing the piece and put it online.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I remember taking this approach with{' '}
              <a href="https://youtu.be/SiuX6ZRpbs0">learning Swedish</a> and I
              managed to pull it off.{' '}
              <a href="https://www.galiway.blog/deadline/">
                By giving myself a deadline
              </a>
              , it lit a fire under me to be committed to learning how to play
              the piano.
            </p>
            <p>
              My time in front of the piano was stacking up again and although I
              didn’t commit as much time as I had done previously, I could feel
              and hear an improvement. Perhaps, the thought of looking like a
              failure on the internet was enough motivation to keep me going.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had tracked the amount of time I had spent in front of the piano
              and you can see the difference once I gave myself a deadline.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re struggling with staying consistent with your own
              practice, I find it helpful to hold yourself accountable with
              little (or big) goals. Give yourself a deadline to perform a song,
              record 5 songs by the end of the month or perform a piece to your
              friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whatever it is, keeping yourself accountable is important when
              learning the piano. It’s even better to share your journey with
              friends and family so that they can hold you accountable as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, by giving yourself a hard deadline you stay clear from the
              infamous issue that every creator goes through; wanting it to be
              perfect. There’s nothing wrong with striving for perfection, but
              if left unchecked it can be a slippery slope.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than spending all of your time on getting the perfect take,
              you could be focusing on other, more important aspects of playing
              piano. Don’t waste your time on such things. Keep moving forward
              and focusing on improving your skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I gave myself a deadline and I was going to release it no matter
              what. Whether I bombed or sounded like a complete noob, I was
              going to upload something either way. It was daunting, but by
              doing so it motivated me to get in front of the piano and held me
              accounting with recording and releasing something.
            </p>
            <h5>An On-Going Process</h5>
            <p>
              Answering the question, “how long does it take to play the piano”
              is a difficult one. It really depends on where you want to take it
              and what your goals are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do you want to learn a specific piece? Do you want to learn
              composition? Do you want to understand music theory? Do you want
              to be able to play by ear? Or read music? Or all of the above? As
              you can see there are many aspects to learning piano.
            </p>
            <p>
              My advice is to figure out a rough goal and just start. Sit in
              front of the piano and play. Makes mistakes and just keep on
              playing. Along the way, you’ll figure out what you’re lacking and
              that will take you down another path and so on and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Go slow, be deliberate with your practice time and add in a little
              patience as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.galiway.blog/category/learned/">
                It’s the same mentality that I’ve incorporated with every other
                single skill that I’ve picked up
              </a>
              . Rather than wasting time pondering how long will it take me to
              get good at the skill, I just get stuck in, leap and grow wings on
              the way down.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I’ve shown you from my own progress, daily practice is
              important. You need to be putting in the reps on a daily basis.
              Otherwise, your progress <em>will</em> stagnate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Life will happen and your priorities will change, but if you’re
              really serious with learning how to play the piano then you need
              to hold yourself accountable with practising every single day for
              the rest of your life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning a skill is a lifelong journey. You never really reach the
              finish line. You’re either getting better or worse, there’s no
              in-between.
            </p>
            <h5>Moving Forward</h5>
            <p>
              I started this project trying to learn piano by playing a specific
              piece and that’s what I managed to do. The thing is, I realised
              that if I want to get better at playing piano I’m going to have to
              commit even more time and effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frankly, I have other projects that I would like to explore.
              That’s not to say that I won’t be playing piano anymore, I just
              won’t play it as often.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’ll be likely that I will regress with this skill, but I’m okay
              with that, it’s one of the reasons why I recorded myself, so when
              I’m grey and old I can remind myself that I could play something a
              little more complex than{' '}

            <p>
              I hope this article inspires you to take up the challenge of
              learning how to play the piano and give you insight into how much
              time and dedication you’re going to have to commit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone will have a different journey. It’s just a matter of how
              dedicated are you to learning the instrument.

              If you reached this far it means that you’re still interested in
              learning the piano. I thought I’d give you a little treat and
              share with you my progress throughout the months in video format.
              Perhaps, it’ll inspire you to do something similar and hopefully
              better!
