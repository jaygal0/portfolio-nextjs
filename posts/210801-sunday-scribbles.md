I told myself that I want to use this space to write often, as I know the process of writing is beneficial for me. Regardless of who is reading these posts or not, it's important that I dedicate time to writing one post a week.

What that post will be about, I don't know, but the routine of sitting in front of the computer and dedicating time to writing is what I want to focus on. What comes out during that time, I'm not that bothered about.

I'm not trying to be an author, I'm not trying to build a popular blog, I'm not trying to get recognised through my writing. What I'm trying to do is get better at communicating in the written form, I'm trying to get faster at getting the thoughts out of my head and onto 'paper'.

This space is a way for me to put the reps in. By putting in the work on a consistent basis, I can't help but get better at my craft.

To be able to express yourself in written form - and quickly for that matter - is an important skill. Communicating in general is essential, and by getting better at writing it'll tranfer to all forms of communication.

At least, that's what I hope.

That's why I'm going to attempt writing on a weekly basis. Hopefully, dedicating my sunday mornings to creating a post. Forcing myself to create and post something out onto the world wide web.

Hence the title of this article, sunday scribbles.

I'm hoping in a years time I would have posted 52 articles. Some posts are going to be better than the other, but when I look back in a years time, I'm sure it'll put a smile on my face reading back on what I was thinking at that very moment.

I'm looking forward to what I create.
