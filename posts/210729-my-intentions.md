I miss writing.

I don't do it as often as I should, nor do I have a decent excuse for it.

Getting my thoughts out of my head and onto 'paper' is both a calming and rewarding experience.

I used to write often when I tried to build a blog about [accelerated learning](https://galiway.blog). It's sad to say that I've dropped that project, but I learned a great deal from it.

During that time I realised I enjoyed the writing process. It allowed me to think, made me better at communicating and forced me to learn.

Back then, I didn't know much about web design, how the internet runs, I didn't even know how to build a site from scratch. I had built the blog using Wordpress on purpose so that I could understand how the CMS worked. I wanted to reduce costs, so I opted to self-host. I learned a great deal about domains, hosting and everything about the internet, but I was still relying on Wordpress to get my content out onto the internet.

Early 2020, I decided to finally learn how to build and program websites from scratch. After talking to a programmer on my [podcast](https://www.galiway.blog/dimitris-gkiokas-the-meta-learners/), he advised me to learn HTML, CSS as well as Javascript, and all in that order.

Fast forward to the middle of 2021 and I've come a long way.

It puts a smile on my face to think how much I've progressed in such a short little time. I've learned how to program and then some.

Take this website for example. I've built everything from scratch, using Next.js, a framework built of off React that uses Javascript and JSX. I'm writing this article in markdown and it's converted to HTML at build time. The website is styled using styled components. The code sits on Github and is hosted on Vercels servers free of charge. I've built a static website that utilises Next.js framework to make everything run blazingly fast.

When I started my programming journey in 2020, never would I had thought that I would be where I am now. I wouldn't have understood the previous paragraph.

I've learned so much and I still have a lot more to learn. I've only scratched the surface.

I don't need to rely on a CMS to build a blog. I've designed and created a blog from scratch, there's less bloat which makes it fast, I can practically do whatever I want with my website. It's really down to how creative I want to be.

What does all of this got to do with me writing?

Now that I've built my own website using my own systems. It makes the writing process streamlined than what it was before. There's less friction in the creation process, it's simple to create a new post. There's no need to login into Wordpress, navigate through the pages in order to create a new post. I don't need to find the right plugin to make my site work.

All I need to do is create a new markdown file in one folder and let my systems take care of the work.

I can focus on the writing as well as the learning.

I built this website to allow me to learn how programming works. I use this space as a training ground to be better, to make mistakes, and to experiment. Which is no different to how I'm going to treat this writing space.

Unlike my previous blog I don't want to write for a specific niche. My interests change far too quickly, sticking to one subject doesn't interest me. Instead, I want to write whatever I want to write.

But I want to make sure that I'm consistent. That's why I'm going to attempt to commit to writing one post a week. It could be about anything. From life updates to personal interests, there will be no continuity, I just want to write because I know the entire process will be good for me.

My intentions for this space is to allow me to be better on all levels. From programming, to communicating to critical thinking. I've built a space to continue to learn, to make mistakes and to take risks.

Who knows where this will take me.
